# wake-on-lan

# deprecated

## This worked for python2, and please feel free to use it as an excersice for converting to python3, however these days you should simply install `wakeonlan` or `wol` from homebrew or macports and use those.

Send the magic packet to wake up sleeping computers with WOL enabled. Make the script executable with `chmod +x ./wol`. 

Usage:

./wol MAC_ADDRESS MAC_ADDRESS, etc
